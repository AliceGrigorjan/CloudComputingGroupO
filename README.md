# A simple chat server

This is the source code for a very simple chat example, based 
the [Getting Started](http://socket.io/get-started/chat/) guide
of the Socket.IO website, which has been extended by us. Registering with usernames, private chatting and sending multimedia files is now possible.

After cloning this project, run ```npm install``` and afterwards ```npm run start```. The chat server can be reached under ```localhost:3000```.
